I am interested in mastering technologies and developing applications and mechanisms.

I'm currently learning JavaScript, with attempts to create some responsive documents with HTML/css, I use a raspberry as a server to host the site locally and modify through JavaScript.
- 💞️ I seek to collaborate on projects that can direct my skills as a developer, and give me the opportunity to contribute my knowledge and help.
